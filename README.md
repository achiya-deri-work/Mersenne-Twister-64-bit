## Introduction

This is a Python module that implements the Mersenne Twister 64-bit Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG). The Mersenne Twister is a widely-used PRNG known for its long period and good statistical properties, making it suitable for various randomization tasks.

The module provides a user-friendly interface for generating random numbers, shuffling sequences, and sampling elements. It also includes methods for seeding the generator, ensuring reproducibility, and verifying the correctness of the generator's implementation through testing.

## Features

- Generate random floating-point numbers and integers within specified ranges.
- Shuffle sequences using the Mersenne Twister PRNG.
- Sample elements from sequences with optional uniqueness.
- Set and update the internal state of the generator using seed values.
- Verify generator correctness through predefined tests.
- Access to the Mersenne Twister generator methods and attributes at the module level.
